To install libsdl2-dev on Windows, you can follow these steps:

Go to the SDL2 download page 

Here:https://www.matsson.com/prog/sdl2-mingw-w64-tutorial.php
    
and download the latest development library for Windows using MinGW.

Extract the contents of the downloaded file using a tool like 7-Zip.

Copy the contents of the extracted folder to a location on your computer where you want to keep the SDL2 library.

Add the SDL2 library to your project by including the necessary header files and linking to the library file. 

The specific steps for doing this will depend on your development environment and programming language

Note that you will also need to place the SDL2.dll file

in a location where your program can link with it during runtime.

You can either put the dll file in the same directory as your executable or put it in the system directory

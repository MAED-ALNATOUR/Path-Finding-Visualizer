# Path-Finding-Visualizer

Pathfinding visualization is a technique used to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action. It is a useful tool for understanding how different algorithms work and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.

In this program we will visualize Breadth-First Search algorithm.

Breadth-first search is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. 

BFS is a level-based approach that explores all of its neighbor nodes at its next depth before moving on to the other nodes. It can be used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph by keeping track of the distance and parent node of each node in the graph.
